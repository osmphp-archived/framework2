# Architecture #

This section describes the most basic concepts and internal mechanics every Dubysa application relies on. Understanding these concepts is essential to efficient application development.

Fortunately, there are only 3 basic topics to learn:

* how the application works, step by step: where the execution starts, how it dives deeper, what main classes are typically involved and how the result is generated;
* how large application is divided into smaller pieces - modules: what module can do, how it gets involved into application internals, typical structure of the module, how modules are packaged and distributed;
* how Dubysa applications are different from applications based on other PHP frameworks: dynamic traits, optional dependency injection, lazy properties.
