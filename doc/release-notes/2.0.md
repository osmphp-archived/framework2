## What's New ##

`2.0` version doesn't introduce any major features. Beside various bug fixes it contains minor improvements. Most notable improvements:

* View preparation step (`View::prepare()`) is removed; the recommended practice is to prepare the view in `View::rendering()` method.
* `Validation` class supports validation of `bool` properties in payload.

## Updating From 1.x To 2.0 ##

### Updating Your Packages ###

1. Update `require` and `branch-alias` sections of your package's `composer.json` file: 

		...
	    "require": {
			...
	        "dubysa/framework": "2.*"
	    },
		...
	    "extra": {
	        "branch-alias": {
	            "dev-master": "2.x-dev"
	        },
			...
	    }

2. Update installation instruction of your package in its `readme.md` file:

    composer require {package}:2.*


### Updating Your Projects ###
 
1. Update `require` and `scripts` sections of your project's `composer.json` file:

		...
	    "require": {
	        ...
	        "dubysa/framework": "2.*"
	    },
		...
	    "scripts": {
	        "post-root-package-install": [
	            "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('temp/.env', '.env');\"",
	            "@php -r \"file_exists('.env.testing') || copy('temp/.env.testing', '.env.testing');\""
	        ],
	        "post-install-cmd": [
	            "@php fresh",
	            "@php run composer-hooks post-update"
	        ],
	        "post-update-cmd": [
	            "@php fresh",
	            "@php run composer-hooks post-update"
	        ]
	    }
		...

2. Update version constraints of other packages listed in `require` section of your project's `composer.json` files. 
 
	1. For `dubysa/*` packages, change version constraint to `2.*`. 
	2. For other packages, follow version constraint recommended in documentation of each package. 

3. In shell, run:

		composer update 

## Backward-Incompatible Changes ##

1. `Osm\Framework\Http\Errors\Error` and derived classes implement property calculation in `default()` method instead of `__get()` method. 

	If your module implements custom error handling class, move property calculation into `default()` method instead of `__get()` method. 

2. `Osm\Framework\Layers\Layout::prepare()` and `Osm\Framework\Views\View::prepare()` methods are removed.

	If you implemented any logic in `View::prepare()`, move it to `View::rendering()` method.

3. Menu bars and popup menus are temporarily being refactored (may not work) - new components will be released in `3.0` release.
