# Dynamic Traits #

Using dynamic traits, user code can introduce new methods and override existing `public` and `protected` methods in almost any class without editing its source file.

Simply put, dynamic trait is a [PHP trait](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php) added to the class dynamically, without editing its source file.

It gives unprecedented extensibility. You can customize almost any class in the framework, in the 3rd party modules or even in the libraries used by the framework.
