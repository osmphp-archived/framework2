# Introduction #

Osm is modular, extensible, developer-oriented, high-performance, multi-theme PHP Framework.

It is a powerful tool to create any kind of application, starting from simple console command to e-shop or web marketplace.

[Getting started](tutorials/hello-world.html) is very easy!

**TODO**. Add description for VIP: what it is, getting started, adding standard packages (for empty CRUD app, for shop app, ...), where to read more (for general overview, read architecture, if you better learn by example, check tutorials, there are also chapters on specific activities such as Web development, database development, JS development, ...)
