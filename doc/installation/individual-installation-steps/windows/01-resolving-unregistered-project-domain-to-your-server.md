# Resolving Unregistered Project Domain To Your Server #

If you have registered project domain address with your hosting provider, skip this step.

Otherwise you need to let your computer know which server should handle requests to your domain address. 

Open `c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` for editing in Administrative mode and add the following line:

	{server_ip} {project_domain}
