# JavaScript Development #


Scripts are written in ES6 which is supported by all 
latest browser versions.

Osm uses Babel compiler to support older JavaScript version (ES5).

Every module can have own JavaScript file, but browser gets one combined JS file, which is good to be cached on client side.
